The snow leopard (Panthera uncia), also known commonly as the ounce, is a species of large cat 
in the genus Panthera of the family Felidae. The species is native to the mountain ranges of 
Central and South Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global 
population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to 
decline about 10% by 2040. It is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction following 
infrastructural developments. It inhabits alpine and subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000–4,500 m
 (9,800–14,800 ft), ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan 
 Plateau to southern Siberia, Mongolia and western China. In the northern part of its range, 
 it also lives at lower elevations.

Taxonomically, the snow leopard was long classified in the monotypic genus Uncia. 
Since phylogenetic studies revealed the relationships among Panthera species, it has been 
considered a member of that genus. Two subspecies were described based on morphological differences,
 but genetic differences between the two have not been confirmed. It is therefore regarded as a 
 monotypic species.
